# INTRODUCTION:
In the vast world of hospitality industry, understanding the complexities of hotel bookings is essential for providing tailored services to both local and international clients. As a data analyst, I have had the opportunity to analyze the dataset spanning a decade, from January 2010 to December 2019, to unravel the patterns and trends in hotel bookings. This exploration aimed to extract actionable insights that could guide our efforts in optimizing services for international travelers.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The company has identified the need to optimize their services for international travelers, but they lack insights regarding seasonal variations, demographic preferences, payment methods, hotel ratings, and customer satisfaction. Without a deep understanding of these factors, it is challenging to tailor their services to meet the specific needs and expectations of their target audience.

AIM:
The aim of this project is to identify key trends and patterns within the hotel bookings data and provide recommendations to improve the company's services for international travelers. By understanding the factors that influence booking behavior, customer satisfaction, and revenue generation, we can make informed decisions to enhance the overall customer experience and drive business growth.

MY ROLE:
As a data analyst, my role in this project was to analyze the provided dataset, identify trends, patterns, and correlations, and extract insightful information that can directly impact the company's decision-making processes. By utilizing statistical techniques and data visualization tools, I am able to uncover key insights that can inform strategic decisions to improve the company's services for international travelers.

INSIGHTS:
1) Over the 10-year period, there were 66,541 bookings across various hotels, resulting in approximately 152,000 rooms being booked for 266,000 people. The bookings originated from 7 different countries, with the destination countries totaling 20.

2) The booking prices across these hotels ranges from $35 to $578, generating a total revenue of $14.24 million over the 10 years.

3) The number of yearly bookings increased progressively from 2010 to 2019, with a dip in 2013 and 2016. These dips were attributed to global financial crises and high unemployment rates.

RECOMMENDATION:
1) Expand target markets, since the majority of bookings came from Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, it would be beneficial to explore new potential markets. Conduct market research to identify other countries with a growing number of travelers who may be interested in visiting the hotel's destinations.
  
2) Identify previous guests who have rated the hotel highly and develop personalized offers to encourage them to return. This could include loyalty programs and exclusive perks for returning guests, such as discounted rates, room upgrades, or complimentary services.
   
3) Develop diversified marketing strategies, leveraging both online and offline channels. Implement targeted promotions during peak booking seasons and collaborate with travel agencies to attract a broader audience.
   
4) Prioritize safety and communicate enhanced hygiene measures. Provide flexible cancellation policies and special promotions to encourage bookings despite uncertainties. Leverage digital platforms for transparent communication about safety measures.
